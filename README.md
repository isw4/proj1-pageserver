# README #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, introduction to software
engineering,  at University of Oregon.

### What is this repository for? ###

The objectives of this mini-project are:

  * Experience with GIT workflow with separate configuration:  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;  turn in configuration file with reference to repo. (Project 0 is practice for this part.) 
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of basic web architecture
  * Use automated tests to check progress (plus manual tests for good measure)
